          	I am a theater designer and graphic artist born in 1973 in South Korea.
          	I traveled the world with my husband and in 2017 started to draw urban environments in Lisbon, Portugal.
          	These drawings were presented in an exhibition in Seoul, and I produced a <a href="/img/calendar.pdf">calendar for 2018</a>.<br/>
          	Currently, I am looking for unique urban vistas to draw.
